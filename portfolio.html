            <h1>Navaneeth Hari</h1>
            <div id="pg">
                <p>A front-end developer with a passion for turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly websites. I
                    specialize in crafting responsive layouts, smooth animations, and clean, maintainable code that
                    brings great design to life.

                    With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React, I focus on building
                    intuitive user interfaces that not only look good but feel great to use. Whether it’s a personal
                    project or a client’s vision, I aim to deliver seamless digital experiences across all devices.

                    I'm constantly learning and exploring new tools and trends in the ever-evolving front-end world, and
                    I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and creativity.

                    Let’s build something amazing together.
